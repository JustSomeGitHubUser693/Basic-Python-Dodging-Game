Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
During the installation, check 'Add Python X.X to path'. Then click on install now.
If you are on mac, then just skip to the next part, not sure about Linux.

After the installation is complete, open command prompt or terminal (whatever command prompt name your OS uses), then run 'pip install pygame'.
Wait for it to complete. After it is complete, type 'python3 (location of the .py file, found in the downloads folder originally)'.
Have fun with these, you can modify them freely if you want. No need credits since this is not completely all my idea. Note that insane mode with 1 life only may just be straight up impossible.
